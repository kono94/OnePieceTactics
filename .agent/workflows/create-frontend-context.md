@frontend

## Role
Act as a **Senior Vue.js Architect & Technical Lead**.

## Objective
Analyze the current Vue.js 3 codebase and generate a comprehensive `FRONTEND_CONTEXT.md` file. This file will serve as the "Source of Truth" for an AI developer to quickly understand the project's structure, architectural patterns, and design philosophy without needing to re-scan every file.

## Analysis Instructions
1.  **Directory Mapping**:
    - Scan the `frontend` directory structure.
    - Explain the specific purpose of folders like `components`, `views` (if present), `stores`/`pinia`, `composables`, `services`, and `assets`.
2.  **Tech Stack & Configuration Identification**:
    - Build Tool: Identify if it's Vite or Webpack.
    - Language: Check for TypeScript usage and strictness.
    - State Management: Identify Pinia, Vuex, or usage of `reactive`/`ref` for global state.
    - Styling: Detect Tailwind, SCSS, Vanilla CSS, or CSS modules.
3.  **Architectural Patterns**:
    - **Component Style**: Determine if the project uses `<script setup>`, Options API, or Composition API.
    - **Data Flow**: Explain how data moves from the API/Backend -> State -> Components.
    - **Logic Sharing**: Check for the use of Composables (hooks) vs Utility functions.

## Output Requirements (The `FRONTEND_CONTEXT.md` File in the /frontend folder)
The generated file must contain:
1.  **High-Level Summary**: What the application is and its primary goal.
2.  **Tech Stack Table**: Core libraries (Vue, Router, Pinia, etc.) and versions.
3.  **folder-structure.md**: A detailed tree view with comments explaining what belongs where.
4.  **Key Architectural Decisions**:
    - How usage of Global State is handled.
    - The strategy for API communication (e.g., "Services pattern" or "Direct Axios in components").
    - Component design rules (e.g., "Smart vs. Dumb" components).
5.  **Important File Paths**: Locations of [main.ts](cci:7://file:///home/kono/projects/tft-clone/frontend/src/main.ts:0:0-0:0), [App.vue](cci:7://file:///home/kono/projects/tft-clone/frontend/src/App.vue:0:0-0:0), router configuration, and main style definitions.

## Constraint
The output must be technically dense and focused on **intent** and **mechanism**. Do not include generic tutorial text; focus solely on *this* specific project's implementation details.
